This repository is created for some python useful python scripts and code. 

[1) Random Password Generator](https://github.com/MitThakkar24/Python/blob/main/Random%20Password%20Generator.ipynb)

- The script is a Python-based random password generator that utilizes the random and string modules. It combines ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation to create a diverse character set. The password length is set to 16 characters by default, and the script employs random.sample() to ensure uniqueness in the generated password. The resulting password is printed to the console, providing a simple and effective way to generate secure and random passwords.

[2) Simple ATM](https://github.com/MitThakkar24/Python/blob/main/Simple%20ATM.ipynb)

- This ATM class allows users to interact with the system by creating a PIN, depositing or withdrawing money, checking their balance, and exiting the program. Each function performs the specified operation, checking the entered PIN for validation and updating the account balance accordingly.

[3) Fraction Numbers](https://github.com/MitThakkar24/Python/blob/main/Fraction.ipynb)

- The Fraction class is designed to represent and perform arithmetic operations on fractions. It features methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, ensuring accurate computations with numerator and denominator components. The class employs special methods (__add__, __sub__, __mul__, __truediv__) to handle arithmetic operations, returning a new Fraction instance for each operation. This implementation enhances code readability and reusability, providing a versatile tool for working with fractions in Python.
